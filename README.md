The Fun Project
This is a project that allows non technical people to write programming language as though they are writing everyday english language.
Python will be used in the background to analyse the request, carry out necessary actions and display results.

Example:
user types: show - this is me
response: "this is me"
equivalent to (python): print("This is me")
